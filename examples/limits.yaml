# Example limits configuration for metrics-governor
#
# Actions:
#   - log:      Log violation but pass through data (default)
#   - adaptive: Intelligently drop top offenders to stay within limits
#   - drop:     Drop all data when limit exceeded
#
# GroupBy:
#   When using adaptive action, group_by specifies which labels to use for
#   tracking and identifying top offenders. The system will track datapoints
#   and cardinality per unique combination of these labels, and when limits
#   are exceeded, it will drop the groups with the highest contribution first.

defaults:
  max_datapoints_rate: 10000000  # per minute - very high for testing
  max_cardinality: 500000
  action: log
