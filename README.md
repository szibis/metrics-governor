**metrics-governor** is a high-performance metrics proxy supporting both **OTLP** and **Prometheus Remote Write (PRW)** protocols. It sits between your applications and your metrics backend, providing intelligent cardinality control, horizontal scaling via consistent sharding, and full observability for your metrics pipeline.

> **Two Independent Pipelines**: OTLP→OTLP and PRW→PRW. No cross-protocol conversion - each protocol stays native for zero overhead and full feature support.

## Why metrics-governor?

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Cardinality explosions** crushing your backend | **Adaptive limiting** drops only the worst offenders, preserving well-behaved services |
| **Single backend bottleneck** limiting throughput | **Consistent sharding** distributes load across multiple endpoints via K8s DNS discovery |
| **Data loss during outages** | **High-performance persistent queue** with automatic retry and exponential backoff |
| **No visibility** into metrics pipeline | **Real-time statistics** with per-metric cardinality, datapoints, and Prometheus metrics |
| **Unpredictable costs** from runaway metrics | **Per-group tracking** with configurable limits and dry-run mode for safe testing |

## Key Features

- **Dual Protocol Support** - Native OTLP (gRPC/HTTP) and Prometheus Remote Write (PRW 1.0/2.0) pipelines, each running independently with zero conversion overhead
- **Intelligent Limiting** - Unlike simple rate limiters that drop everything, metrics-governor identifies and drops only the top offenders while preserving data from well-behaved services
- **Consistent Sharding** - Automatic endpoint discovery from Kubernetes headless services with consistent hashing ensures the same time-series always route to the same backend (works for both OTLP and PRW)
- **Production-Ready** - FastQueue durable persistence with circuit breaker and exponential backoff, auto memory limits, TLS/mTLS, authentication, compression (gzip/zstd/snappy/lz4), and Helm chart included
- **High-Performance Optimizations** - String interning reduces allocations by 76%, concurrency limiting prevents goroutine explosion, Bloom filters reduce cardinality tracking memory by 98% (techniques inspired by [VictoriaMetrics articles](https://valyala.medium.com/))
- **Zero Configuration Start** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults; add limits and sharding when needed

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start metrics-governor with adaptive limits
metrics-governor \
  -exporter-endpoint otel-collector:4317 \
  -limits-config limits.yaml \
  -limits-dry-run=false \
  -stats-labels service,env

# Your apps send metrics to metrics-governor instead of directly to collector
# App: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://metrics-governor:4317
```

```yaml
# limits.yaml - Adaptive limiting by service
rules:
  - name: "per-service-limits"
    match:
      labels:
        service: "*"
    max_cardinality: 10000
    max_datapoints_rate: 100000
    action: adaptive
    group_by: ["service"]
```

When cardinality exceeds 10,000, metrics-governor identifies which service is the top contributor and drops only that service's metrics, preserving data from well-behaved services.
