We're launching **metrics-governor.io** — the new home for all metrics-governor documentation.

## What's new

- **Organized documentation** — 32 guides organized into 9 categories: Getting Started, Architecture, Governance, Operations, Observability, Protocols, Security, Advanced, and Contributing
- **Full-text search** — Find any configuration option, CLI flag, or concept instantly
- **Interactive Playground** — The Config Playground is now embedded directly in the site
- **Dark mode** — Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Blog** — Follow release announcements, architecture deep-dives, and use case stories

## Why a dedicated docs site?

As metrics-governor has grown to 32 documentation guides, 3,100+ tests, and support for dual OTLP/PRW pipelines, the plain markdown files on GitHub weren't scaling for discovery and navigation. The new site gives you:

- Sidebar navigation with logical categories
- Cross-document search
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout
- Direct links you can share with your team

## What's next

- Version-specific documentation
- Architecture deep-dives
- Community use case stories
- API reference generation

Explore the docs at [metrics-governor.io/docs](/docs/getting-started/installation) or try the [Config Playground](/playground).
